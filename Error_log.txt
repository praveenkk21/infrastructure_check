Possible solutions:
 •  Ensure application is opened and the UI element is visible on the screen at execution time
 •  Edit the Target of the UI activity and use Validation to debug the issue.
 •  If needed, re-indicate the element as its properties might have changed
 •  Use "Check state" activity to check the application state before executing the action
 •  Increase the "Delay before" value to allow time to the application to render entirely and become responsive
